Note:
In the bookmark view, there is no edit button, if you want to delete an item, simply wipe the item from right to left and you will be able to delete it.
Realized the "Show the popover on iPhone that is not full screen" function. 
Tried to enable larger fonts, but seems like nothing will happen.
Other functions are all realized.
